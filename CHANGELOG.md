**Updated** mod to Minecraft 1.15.2  

**Added** Item Stand  
The Item Stand can display any Item or Block you want. 
It can change into 4 different forms (one is invisible), and it contains options to transform, rotate, spin, and scale the displayed Item. 
It is excellent for shop signs, interior design, and adding extra detail to builds.

**Added** Mob Beacon  
The Mob Beacon will prevent natural enemy spawning in its placed chunk. 
This was added due to the lack of Mob prevention options in mods for 1.15.2.
